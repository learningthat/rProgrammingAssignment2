# Assignment: caching the inverse of a matrix
# 
# Functions:
# makeCacheMatrix: 
# cacheSolve: 
#
# Assumptions: Matrix is always invertible (i.e. no further checks)


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
# This function caches a matrix.

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
# This function 
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
